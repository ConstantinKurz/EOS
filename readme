Different EOS files prepared for usage in ETK. 


Conversion to ETK Units:
mu/=7.514e5*.4627;
p/=7.514e5*.4627;
rho*=939.5/7.514e5/.4627;


============================================
myeos is stefans/veronicas model and already in 
Cactusunits
Units and first 3 coloumns:
mu = MeV/fm^3 rho = 1/fm^3 press = MeV/fm^3

============================================
SLypp.dat is SLy eos
Units and coloumns:
n_B = 1/fm^3  rho = g/cm^3 press = dyn/cm^2
SlyppETK.dat is converted to Cactusunits
same units as myeos.dat
 
============================================
eosQxP.dat is QxP EOS
Units:
mu = MeV/fm^3 rho = 1/fm^3 press = MeV/fm^3
ETK version also in Cactusunits
